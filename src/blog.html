          There is a modern-classic psychology study that gave people a tough attention test, then a break, then the same test over again. During the break, some of the participants walked through a big green urban park, while others walked through a downtown area. After the break, the park group scored significantly higher on the test — their brains refreshed from the leafy views in a way that the brains navigating busy sidewalks and storefronts and streets were not.

          In the decade since that experiment, further studies have made it abundantly clear that greenery has a special power to sharpen our focus. The effect holds true whether people immerse themselves in dense vegetation, glance out the window at a green roof, or merely look up at a desk plant. The leading explanation why is called “attention restoration theory”: it suggests that greenery restores the brain through soft fascination, like a little waking nap.

          This line of research is an important one for planners and developers focused on improving quality of life in cities. While the environmental imperative for urban trees is a given, the science shows the value of green space for mental health and worker productivity, too. Preserving access to green space in dense urban neighborhoods is an ongoing battle, so it’s worth remembering just how essential parks are to our basic well-being.
          
          But something has changed in these past 10 years about the way we take breaks, walk through cities and parks, or do just about anything: smartphones (and other connected devices) have become our ubiquitous companion. There’s an open question about whether trees retain their restorative power in the face of digital competition. In other words, could screens mitigate — or even negate — nature’s ability to refresh our attentions?
          
          A research team explored this very issue for the first time in a clever new study, and the results don’t bode well for our collective focus. In a paper published in a recent issue of the journal Environment and Behavior, the researchers report that “to enhance your attention functioning it is not enough to go to a green space; the evidence here suggests you have to put aside your electronic devices in that space.”
