#### This website is to serve as a portfolio of my work as a Junior Developer and to explain to future employers who I am and what I can bring to the table.

The website begins with a landing page and has the following links to other pages:
     
 1. About
 2. Portfolio of Work
 3. Twitter Feed
 4. Contact

Each page is minimal in nature as I do not feel that a website with lots of pictures, color, and animation is representative of me. I do however feature a flipping card on the Landing page, showing off three websites I have coded in various states of responsiveness, and a link to my LinkedIn, GitHub, professional Twitter, and downloadable resume on every page for convenience.

This website was written with future employers, clients, recruiters, family, and friends in mind to show off what I have been doing and what I am capable of. I coded this site in HTML and pure CSS, ensuring accessibility is to the higest standard.
