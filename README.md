#### This website is to serve as a portfolio of my work as a Junior Developer and to explain to future employers who I am and what I can bring to the table.

The repo can be found at https://github.com/mollymadden/portfolio

The website begins with a landing page and has the following links to other pages:
     
 1. About
 2. Portfolio
 3. Blog
 4. Contact

Each page is minimal in nature as I do not feel that a website with lots of pictures, color, and animation is representative of me. I do however feature a flipping card on the Landing page, showing off three websites I have coded in various states of responsiveness, and a link to my LinkedIn, GitHub, professional Twitter, and downloadable resume on every page for convenience.

The About page features a flipping card with two pictures of myself, and a scrolling horizontal timeline to provide greater detail on my work and education history.

The Portfolio page features three cards at the moment, showing off my terminal app, this website, and a placeholder for something 'coming soon.'

The Blog page features 5 scrolling blog posts and a table of contents.

Finally, the Contact page features a contact form linked with Formspree, and greater detail about how I can be reached.

This website was written with future employers, clients, recruiters, family, and friends in mind to show off what I have been doing and what I am capable of. I coded this site in HTML and pure CSS, ensuring accessibility is to the higest standard.
